# -EXPLORATION-OF-WALMART-RETAIL-SALES-DATA-A-DESCRIPTIVE-APPROACH
Retail is one of the largest and most important industries, and as the middle class grows in size and purchasing power, this industry is likely to thrive. Because of its early applications of Big Data Analytics in its business processes, Walmart is widely regarded as the world's largest and most successful brick-and-mortar retailer. The goal of this study is to investigate Walmart's retail sales using Tableau software in a descriptive approach with six metrics - average sales, profit, and discount, distribution of average profit by state in the United States, percentage of profit per region, sales profits per month, average sales profit based on age, and Sub-category per average profit. The three theme solutions preceding the six key metrics were decision support, customer retention, and inventory management.
